It samples the instruction algorithms of the targeted icons and tries to introduce fairly coarse memory faults into the icon\u2019s most frequently accessed code segments. In cybercombat, that translates to a direct attack on the Condition Monitor of the decker\u2019s persona or IC icon.\nThe attack utility affects on-line icons only and has no effect on a decker\u2019s meatbody or cyberdeck. The armor utility reduces the Power of damage done by attack utilities.",

The target decker must make an Evasion (Track Rating) Test. If the Evasion Test fails to yield an equal or greater number of successes, the attacker\u2019s track utility locks onto the target decker\u2019s datatrail and begins its location cycle. Divide 10 by the attacker\u2019s net successes to determine how many turns the track utility needs to locate the target decker\u2019s jackpoint.\nFor the purposes of measuring the location cycle, only count full Combat Turns. If a decker can destroy the utility before the last Initiative Pass of a Combat Turn is completed, that turn is not considered completed.\nThe target decker can try to escape the attacking decker by logging off or jacking out. However, the track utility makes logoff operations more difficult.\nTargeted deckers can use the relocate utility against track programs (see Relocate). Of course, the target decker can always crash the attacking persona, which would stop all its pesky programs.",
