            A security sheaf describes the security measures in place on a host or
            grid as well as how the host/grid reacts to intruders. Quite simply, a
            sheaf consists of a list of trigger steps. <br/><br/>
            These steps represent security tally thresholds. As a deckerâ€™s security
            tally reaches each trigger step, the system activates one or more IC
            programs. Trigger steps also activate the various alert levels in a
            system. The alert status of the system, in turn, affects the types of IC
            programs the system activates. <br/><br/>
            The security code of the host/grid determines the frequency of trigger
            steps in a system, and the game-master determines the events activated by
            each trigger step. <br/><br/>
            Game-masters may use their own discretion or random generation to
            determine these events.
