	<h2>Matrix Security Sheaf</h2>

	<p>
		A security sheaf describes the security measures in place on a host or
		grid as well as how the host/grid reacts to intruders. Quite simply, a
		sheaf consists of a list of trigger steps. <br />
		These steps represent security tally thresholds. As a deckerâ€™s security
		tally reaches each trigger step, the system activates one or more IC
		programs. Trigger steps also activate the various alert levels in a
		system. The alert status of the system, in turn, affects the types of IC
		programs the system activates. <br />
		The security code of the host/grid determines the frequency of trigger
		steps in a system, and the game-master determines the events activated by
		each trigger step. <br />
		Game-masters may use their own discretion or random generation to
		determine these events.
