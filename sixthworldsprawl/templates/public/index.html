                    Contained within, will be a host of generators and rollers to

                    Plus features for anyone to enjoy, even non-players, such as

                    funniest moments.

                    For those familiar with that site, a lot of the features that I
                    want to add to this site will be the same types of tools that
                    you find there.
                    <br/>
                    However, it is important to note
                    <strong>They have a team, I am doing this by myself.</strong>

                    <strong>Only 3rd Edition is supported at this time.</strong>
                    <br/>
                    This is very much a personal project and I am working on it
                    because 3rd Edition is the version that I mostly play and the
                    one that I want to work on first.
                    <br/>
                    While some planned features like the generators (magical groups,
                    corps, missions, etc) might be able to be used with other
                    editions with minor tweaks they will be primarily made with 3rd
                    edition rules in mind.
                    <br/>
                    However, when the 3rd edition features are complete and I feel
                    that it is in a good spot, I would very much like to start
                    making the site work with all editions of the game.

                    <br/>
                    I'm gonna be honest here, I am making this becuase of my love
                    for the game and the setting of Shadowrun. But I know that I
                    dont have any of the rights to that IP, Topps can come in at any
                    moment and shut this project down and I would just have to deal
                    with that.
                    <br/>
                    However,
                    <strong>this site isn't commercialized in any way </strong>, I
                    am making absolutly no money off of it. You will never see ads
                    on my site (I can't stand em, and dont wanna deal with em), and
                    servers that are hosting this site are run by me personally.
                    <br/>
                    That said, so long as the site stays small and goes unnoticed I
                    will probably be fine. If it gets popular and starts getting
                    attention then, frankly, all bets are off.
